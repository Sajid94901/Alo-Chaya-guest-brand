        <p class="mb-4">
            The **Lighthouse Doctrine** is our guiding principle. It asserts that the leader's role is one of **Faithful Stewardship**, not corporate monarchy. The leader is a servant of the Doctrine, not a master of the Guild.
        </p>

                    <h3>The Project Lead (The First Servant)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The leader is primarily responsible for maintaining **Spiritual Purity** and the **Integrity of the Doctrine**. They are the steward of the **Mutual Crisis Fund** and the final guarantor of the **Dignity Wage**. Their goal is not maximizing profit, but **maximizing moral resilience**.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Lighthouse & The Riverine Seclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The resort is designed to be a **Lighthouse**—a source of moral clarity and a spiritual sanctuary (**Riverine Seclusion**). The leader ensures that the physical space and the operational doctrine (the **Konohana Kitan Service Model**) reflect this purity.

        <p class="mb-4">
            The most critical strategic element is the **Legacy Guardrail**. These non-negotiable checks protect the Guild's financial and moral integrity, ensuring the Doctrine survives the successor.

                    <p>
                        The successor must demonstrate their ability to reject **Bidirectional Exploitation** and safeguard the Guild from **External Contamination**—specifically by protecting the Guild's moral sanctity from personal life vulnerabilities.

                    <p>
                        The Project Lead's legacy is defined by **Faithful Stewardship**, as demonstrated by the **COVID-19 Test** (prioritizing staff wages over profit). The successor must swear an oath to maintain the **Dignity Wage (88k Universalist)**, the **Mutual Crisis Fund**, and the **Guild Founder's Rule** (no debt, gambling, loans).

                <h3 class="text-danger">Legacy Guardrail: Rejection of Status</h3>
                <p>
                    The Guild must never be treated as a private fiefdom or source of personal status. The successor is a servant of the **Lighthouse Doctrine**. If the successor fails the **Guardrail of Integrity**, a committee of senior Universalists and the Investor will determine a new Project Lead.
