    <h2 id="recruitment-title">Recruitment Process: The Anti-CV Audit</h2>
    <p id="recruitment-lead">Our selection process is designed to filter for **capacity, character, and competence** by rigorously challenging paper credentials. We treat the CV as a hypothesis to be disproved, using the **ACEM** as the objective scoring tool to identify ethical and competency gaps.</p>

    <div class="detail-cards-container">
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Phase 1: The Dark Triad Filter</h4>
            <p>Every application is audited for **Narcissism and Entitlement** (using the **ACEM Individual Block**). High prestige markers (foreign degrees, old publications) trigger increased scrutiny in the interview to screen for the **Vice of Intellectual Arrogance.**</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Phase 2: The L1 Generalist Challenge</h4>
            <p>The technical interview is not a test of memory, but of **synthesis**. Candidates must immediately integrate abstract theory (like Mintzberg's 5Ps) into the **ACEM structure** (e.g., justifying the 88k wage with the Skill Block). Failure to synthesize is flagged as a **Level 1 Generalist.**</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Phase 3: The GLSM Vice-Diagnosis</h4>
            <p>The final hiring recommendation is based on a **GLSM Vice-Diagnosis**. We don't say "under-qualified." We diagnose the core fault: "Candidate exhibits the **Vice of Lethargy**, which conflicts with the Virtue of Diligence required by the Objective Standard."</p>

<section class="main-section" id="onboarding">
    <h2 id="onboarding-title">Onboarding: Process, Action, and OODA</h2>
    <p id="onboarding-lead">Onboarding is not paperwork; it is the immediate establishment of **process adherence** and the shift from "talk culture" to "act culture." We enforce the **OODA Loop** within the first week to prioritize speed and quality decision-making over academic perfection.</p>

    <div class="detail-cards-container">
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>First 24 Hours: Process Audit</h4>
            <p>The new hire's minute task is to **audit their job process** against the **5Ps of SHRM** and identify one **Mu (Muda, Mura, Muri)** to reduce. This immediately tests and proves their **Conscientiousness** (ACEM Individual Block) by demanding practical improvement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>First 7 Days: Enforced OODA Loop</h4>
            <p>New hires complete timed diagnostic tasks (e.g., addressing a student complaint) that force them through **Observe-Orient-Decide-Act** in under 60 minutes. This is a direct test of the individual's ability to act decisively, punishing **Lethargy** and rewarding high-quality friction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Follower Level Progression</h4>
            <p>All training goals are set using **Kelley's Follower Types**. We bypass generic leadership training and diagnose the new hire's current engagement, setting explicit goals to evolve them toward the **Exemplary Follower** type (ACEM Skill Block 2).</p>

<section class="main-section" id="orientation">
    <h2 id="orientation-title">Orientation: Anchoring Ethics and Culture</h2>
    <p id="orientation-lead">Orientation is the process of cultural and ethical alignment, contrasting our **Task-Oriented culture** with the local **Person-Oriented culture** to prevent conflict. It is an affirmation of the **Common Heart Doctrine** and the ethical obligation tied to the 88k Dignity Wage.</p>

    <div class="detail-cards-container">
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Ethical Commitment Sign-Off</h4>
            <p>Employees sign a commitment document affirming their understanding of the **Virtue-Vice Spectrum**. This makes the demonstration of **Honesty** and **Diligence** an explicit contractual and ethical obligation, not just a suggestion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Cultural Alignment Check</h4>
            <p>The briefing explicitly contrasts the desired **Task-Oriented Culture** (Trompenaars) with the local **Person-Oriented Culture**. We make the difference transparent, forcing the employee to consciously choose to shed habits that prioritize connections over objective output.</p>

        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>Ghuraba Guild Perspective</h4>
            <p>The **88k Dignity Wage** is tied to the **Ghuraba Guild Perspective**. Employees are reminded that their sloth or low performance is an **injustice** to their highly-paid colleagues, tying personal ethics directly to strategic financial practices (5Ps of Strategy).</p>

    <h2 id="performance-title">Performance Management: The Character Audit (BARS & 360)</h2>
    <p id="performance-lead">Performance management is the objective enforcement of the **Common Heart Doctrine** via data. We use **Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS)** and **360-Degree Feedback** across all levels to replace subjective judgment with objective behavioral scores, making it impossible for low-capacity individuals to hide behind a title.</p>

    <div class="detail-cards-container">
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>BARS: Measuring Character, Not Just Output</h4>
            <p>We use **BARS** (Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales) to score **Virtues and Vices** (Aristotelian Spectrum), ensuring performance is measured against observable, minute behaviors, not just general outcomes. This ties the **ACEM Individual Block** directly to the performance review.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Example (BARS for Diligence):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Exemplary (7.5):** Employee's daily Kata checklist shows proactive **Reduction of Muri (Overburden)** in their own process, independently resolving systematic friction points. (ACEM Virtue: Diligence)</li>
                    <li>**Needs Improvement (4.0):** Employee only fixes process friction when explicitly asked or when a task is personally blocked. Shows no initiative to audit workflow. (ACEM Vice: Lethargy)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>360-Degree Feedback: Auditing the Hierarchy</h4>
            <p>360-degree feedback is applied at **all levels** to prevent **Credential-Based Arrogance** from insulating any employee. It ensures that an Executive is audited not just by supervisors, but by the people they impact most—their subordinates and peers.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Application (All Levels):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Professor Level:** A Professor's score is equally weighted by their students (reporting **L1 Generalism** in the Skill Block) and support staff (reporting **Dark Triad** entitlement/abuse).</li>
                    <li>**Executive Level:** The CEO's **Authenticity** and **Justice** (Virtues) are scored by direct reports on whether directives are clear and ethically sound, not just strategically successful.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="detail-card">
            <h4>The ACEM Score: The Final Judgment</h4>
            <p>The BARS/360 data forms the only input for the employee's **ACEM Score**. This score is the objective standard for professional evolution, promotion, and termination, making subjective managerial preference irrelevant.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Final Integration:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Pay:** Raises and bonuses are exclusively tied to a rising ACEM Score, reinforcing the Objective Standard.</li>
                    <li>**Intervention:** A consistently low ACEM Score triggers mandatory, immediate intervention via the **GLSM diagnostic flow** (Observe -> Orient -> Decide on a Vice Prescription), bypassing the typical bureaucratic HR warning process.</li>
