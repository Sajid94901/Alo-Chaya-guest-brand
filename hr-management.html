        <p class="mb-4">
            The Bureau of Harmony is decentralized. The traditional, un-coachable central HR function is stripped of moral authority. All ethical compliance is handled by the **HR Moral Auditor** at the branch level, who acts as the Specialist’s direct guardian.

            The Bureau of Harmony enforces the moral purity of the Guild, protecting it from both internal and external corruption, as mandated by the Founder's Rule.

                    <p>
                        Guests are treated as students in the Training Centre. The Guild has the **absolute, non-negotiable right to eject** any guest engaging in gross moral failures (e.g., exploitation, adultery) that violate the spiritual purity and integrity of the Common Heart.

                        </ol>
                        The **Guild Founder's Rule** (no gambling, internal loans, or debt) is absolute.

        <p class="mb-4">
            We do not just "hire" people. We begin the **Employee Story**. Our system is a data-driven model designed for personalization, connecting every stage of the employee lifecycle. This ensures we recruit the right people, grow them as Specialists, and learn from their journey to constantly improve the Guild.

                    <p>All applications are assessed based on the **ACEM Purity Mandate**. We test *only* for skills 100% relevant to the codified job role. We ban all irrelevant academic and cultural barriers, ensuring a fair, merit-based selection.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            The **ACEM (Audit, Codify, Execute, Maintain) Score** is the single, objective standard for performance, promotion, and pay. It replaces all subjective reviews and political biases. It is the engine that drives our merit-based culture and ensures personalization.

                    <h3>What is ACEM?</h3>
                    <p>ACEM is a continuous process, not a one-time review:</p>
                    <ol class="small mt-2" style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Audit:</strong> We audit the *actual* duties and value-add of a role.</li>
                        <li><strong>Codify:</strong> We write these duties into a clear, non-negotiable job description.</li>
                        <li><strong>Execute:</strong> The Specialist executes these duties. Their performance against these codified metrics *is* their score.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain:</strong> We maintain "ACEM Purity" by constantly removing irrelevant metrics and ensuring tests are 100% tied to the codified duties.</li>

                </div>

                    <h3>The ACEM Score &amp; Pay</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your **ACEM Score** is the only metric for advancement. There is no subjective "manager review."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pay, bonuses, and promotions are **directly and mathematically linked** to this score. This provides the Specialist with absolute clarity on how to succeed and guarantees they are judged only on their relevant contribution.

        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Employee Lifecycle Data Model</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The ACEM system is powered by the **Employee Life Cycle** data model (from your diagram). This is how we achieve true personalization:

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    We continuously connect **Performance Info**, **Leave Data**, and **Career Surveys** with the initial **Assessment Data** (CV, course outlines). When a Specialist separates, their **Exit Interview** (feedback on Role, Line Manager, Tenure) is not filed away—it becomes **Linked Data**.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    This data loop allows us to:

                    <li>Recognize and learn from our "Stalwarts."</li>
                    <li>Use data from "Terminations" to refine the "Next Role" and improve the "Audit" phase for the next Specialist.</li>
