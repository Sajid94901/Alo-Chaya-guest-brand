            The Bureau of Harmony is decentralized. The traditional, un-coachable central HR function is stripped of moral authority. All ethical compliance is handled by the **HR Moral Auditor** at the branch level, who acts as the Specialist’s direct guardian.

            The Bureau of Harmony enforces the moral purity of the Guild, protecting it from both internal and external corruption, as mandated by the Founder's Rule.

                    <p>
                        Guests are treated as students in the Training Centre. The Guild has the **absolute, non-negotiable right to eject** any guest engaging in gross moral failures (e.g., exploitation, adultery) that violate the spiritual purity and integrity of the Common Heart.

                        </ol>
                        The **Guild Founder's Rule** (no gambling, internal loans, or debt) is absolute.

            We do not just "hire" people. We begin the **Employee Story**. Our system is a data-driven model designed for personalization, connecting every stage of the employee lifecycle. This ensures we recruit the right people, grow them as Specialists, and learn from their journey to constantly improve the Guild.

            The **ACEM (Audit, Codify, Execute, Maintain) Score** is the single, objective standard for performance, promotion, and pay. It replaces all subjective reviews and political biases. It is the engine that drives our merit-based culture and ensures personalization.

                    <p>ACEM is a continuous process, not a one-time review:</p>

                        <li><strong>Audit:</strong> We audit the *actual* duties and value-add of a role.</li>
                        <li><strong>Codify:</strong> We write these duties into a clear, non-negotiable job description.</li>
                        <li><strong>Execute:</strong> The Specialist executes these duties. Their performance against these codified metrics *is* their score.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain:</strong> We maintain "ACEM Purity" by constantly removing irrelevant metrics and ensuring tests are 100% tied to the codified duties.</li>

                    <p>
                        Your **ACEM Score** is the only metric for advancement. There is no subjective "manager review."

                    <p>
                        Pay, bonuses, and promotions are **directly and mathematically linked** to this score. This provides the Specialist with absolute clarity on how to succeed and guarantees they are judged only on their relevant contribution.

                    We continuously connect **Performance Info**, **Leave Data**, and **Career Surveys** with the initial **Assessment Data** (CV, course outlines). When a Specialist separates, their **Exit Interview** (feedback on Role, Line Manager, Tenure) is not filed away—it becomes **Linked Data**.
